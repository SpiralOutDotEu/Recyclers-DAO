### 1. Introduction

#### Problem Statement

The world is drowning in waste, and recycling is a vital solution. However, the effectiveness of recycling programs relies on accurate waste identification, which is often a laborious and error-prone process.

#### Solution

**Recyclers DAO** leverages the power of decentralization to build a vast, reliable database for waste identification and recycling. We enable users to contribute and validate data, fostering a collaborative ecosystem that rewards participants with ReDAO tokens.

#### Vision and Mission

**Vision:** A world where waste is efficiently recycled, contributing to a cleaner and sustainable future.

**Mission:** To create a decentralized AI-powered platform that empowers individuals to contribute to waste identification and recycling efforts while earning rewards.

### 2. How It Works

#### DAO Structure

- A decentralized autonomous organization governed by smart contracts on the Filecoin EVM and storage in IPFS.
- Community-driven decision-making and transparent governance.

#### Tokenomics

- ReDAO tokens: Utility and governance token.
- Users purchase and stake tokens for authority to submit and validate images.
- Token rewards for contributions and validations.

#### Data Collection Process

- Users submit images of products and waste.
- Additional fields: brand, barcode, material type, etc.

#### Validation and Rewards

- Community members validate submissions.
- Rewards in ReDAO tokens for both contributors and validators.
- A trustless and incentive-driven ecosystem.
